# Learner Log Entry #1 

## Prompts
Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:

### Rose:
The idea of running Linux on windows was very interesting. I have been a windows user since 2000 and this is my first time using such hybrid system.
I was familiar with Git and Github. Connecting them with Linux based system is something I learned new.

### Bud: 
Using the Linux environment can open a lot of new doors in my research. I mark this as my beginning towards my journey as a computation designer.
The use of GPT 4.0 with visualization capacity opens new dimensions to research. Although they need some varification from the user end, this does open doors to quicker data visualization and analysis of quantitive data.

### Thorn: 
I faced immense trouble setting up the linux system.
The idea of directory and push to git is still challenging to me. I am forking this entry to git as I could not operate a lot of things on the linux environment.

## Additional thought
The setup process on windows could be described in a more thorough process. That would bridge the gap in my understanding of the system.
